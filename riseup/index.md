On our one-year-anniversary, Amateur Oceanic Esports is excited to present Rise Up Community Invitational! The Rise Up Invitational is an invite only tournament for eight of the region's best up and coming teams, around the contenders trials level. These teams will compete against each other over five weeks for a share of the $400 prize pool. Matches will be streamed and casted by the best available talent out there every Sunday and Monday night from 7pm AEST onwards on our twitch channel, AOEsportslink.

The first four weeks of the Rise Up Invitational will be a round robin bracket played between all eight teams. Each team will play one match every Sunday and Monday night, and will all be streamed once a week. After the round robin bracket the top four teams will enter the playoffs in our final week. The semi finals will be played on the Sunday night of the fifth week, and the grand finals the day after (the 16th and 17th of September respectively).

The Rise Up Invitational will kick off Sunday the 19th of August so mark your calendars and come cheer on your favourite teams! More information will be released during the coming days so keep your eyes peeled.

All 4 maps will be played in each match of the round robin. The first map is pre-determined by AOE, the remaining maps are chosen by the loser of the previous map. 

Control | Escort | Assault | Hybrid
------------ | ------------- | ------------ | -------------
Lijiang Tower | Rialto | Horizon Lunar Colony  | King's Row
N/A | Watchpoint: Gibraltar | Temple of Anubis | Eichenwalde
 

For playoffs, the format is Bo5, so once one team wins 3 maps, the game is over and no more maps need to be played. The 5th map will be Nepal. In the case of 2 map ties, the 6th map will be Ilios.
